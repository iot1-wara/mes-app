# MES Production Control System – Roadmap 2026

_Document version: v1.0 — July 2026_

---

## 1. Vision & Goals

A professional, scalable Manufacturing Execution System that connects machines via OPC UA and MQTT, collects time-series data, manages production orders, and provides real-time visibility through a reactive dashboard.

**Objectives:**
- Reliable machine data acquisition at high frequency (second-level)
- Complete order lifecycle management (create → release → execute → complete)
- Real-time monitoring with low-latency dashboards
- Production-grade security and reliability
- Maintainable, testable codebase

---

## 2. Phases & Milestones

### Phase 1 — Foundation Hardening _(Weeks 1–4)_

**Goal:** Bring the current codebase to a stable, production-ready baseline.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1.1 | Remove `.env` from Git; create `.env.example` | Critical | 15 min | ⬜ pending |
| 1.2 | Add JWT authentication (NestJS `@nestjs/passport`) + global AuthGuard | Critical | 1–2 days | ⬜ pending |
| 1.3 | Add role-based access control (Admin / Operator / Viewer) | High | 1 day | ⬜ pending |
| 1.4 | Remove OPC UA `uncaughtException` suppression; implement real error handling | Critical | 2–3 hrs | ⬜ pending |
| 1.5 | Implement WebSocket gateway for live edge telemetry (frontend already references it) | High | 2–3 hrs | ⬜ pending |
| 1.6 | Add rate limiting + request validation on all public endpoints | Medium | 2 hrs | ⬜ pending |

**Exit Criteria:** All API routes protected, no critical vulnerabilities, live dashboard data flowing via WebSocket.

---

### Phase 2 — Complete Feature Set _(Weeks 5–8)_

**Goal:** Every module in the frontend has full CRUD capabilities matching the backend API.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|--------|

| 2.2 | Alarms: acknowledge inline, bulk operations, export | Medium | 1 day | ⬜ pending |
| 2.3 | Traces: add filter by key_data_point + value range search | Medium | 1 day | ⬜ pending |
| 2.4 | Global API error handling in React (interceptor + toast notifications) | High | 2–3 hrs | ⬜ pending |
| 2.5 | Machines: add bulk import (CSV/Excel), template download | Low | 1 day | ⬜ pending |

**Exit Criteria:** All backend REST endpoints have corresponding frontend forms; no orphan API calls with no UI.

---

### Phase 3 — Time-Series Data Architecture _(Weeks 9–12)_

**Goal:** Migrate machine telemetry from PostgreSQL to TimescaleDB for performance and scalability.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|--------|

| 3.3 | Update TypeScript DTOs and DataPointEntity to use Timescale extensions | High | 1 day | ⬜ pending |
| 3.4 | Implement retention policies (keep raw data 90 days, roll up to 1-min averages for 1 year) | High | 2 days | ⬜ pending |
| 3.5 | Add chunking configuration (daily chunks with automatic compression) | Medium | 1 day | ⬜ pending |
| 3.6 | Benchmarks: measure write throughput before/after migration | High | 2–3 hrs | ⬜ pending |

### Phase 4 — Production Workflows _(Weeks 13–16)_

**Goal:** Complete order lifecycle and production management features.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Status |

## 3. Technology Stack Summary

| Layer | Current Stack | Planned Changes |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Backend** | NestJS 11 + TypeScript 5.7 | passport-jwt, `@nestjs/swagger`, class-validator |
| **Frontend** | React 19 + Vite 7 + Tailwind 4 | Chart.js / Recharts (Phase 5), WebSocket client |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 (Docker) | → TimescaleDB extension (Phase 3) |
| **OPC UA** | `node-opcua` v2.175 | Connection retry + write-back support |
| **MQTT** | `mqtt` v5.15 | QoS configuration + topic routing |
| **Tests** | Jest + Supertest (E2E only) → Unit tests (Phase 6) |
| **Deploy** | pm2 / Docker Compose / nginx | Docker Swarm or K8s evaluation (future) |

---

## 4. Key Architecture Decisions & Rationale

### 4.1 Why TimescaleDB over InfluxDB?

- **Minimal migration effort**: Extension on existing PostgreSQL installation
- **SQL everywhere**: No new query language (Flux), existing TypeORM + SQL knowledge reusable
- **Single deployment unit**: Docker Compose change only (`postgres:16` → `timescale/timescaledb`)
- **Hybrid benefit**: Still full relational queries for orders, alarms, machines — only hypertable for time-series data

### 4.2 WebSocket vs Polling

- Real-time dashboards require WebSocket (Phase 1) or SSE — polling introduces unacceptable latency for production monitoring
- NestJS `@nestjs/websocket` with `@nestjs/platform-ws` adapter

### 4.3 Authentication Strategy

- JWT access tokens + refresh token rotation
- Stored in HTTP-only cookies (XSS protection)
- Passport LocalStrategy for login form, JWTStrategy for API routes

---

## 5. Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| OPC UA connection instability with real PLCs | High | High | Implement circuit breaker pattern; fallback to manual refresh |
| TimescaleDB data migration corrupts existing data | Medium | Low | Full PostgreSQL backup + validation script before cutover |
| JWT token rotation complexity | Medium | Medium | Use established library (`@nestjs/jwt`), thorough testing |
| Frontend performance with large trace datasets | High | Medium | Server-side pagination (already planned), virtual scrolling chart renders |

---

## 6. Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target (Phase 3) | Target (Phase 6) |
|--------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Write throughput (data points/sec) | ~PQ row inserts | >50K/sec (hypertable) | >100K/sec (compressed) |
| API response time (p95) | Unknown | <200ms | <100ms |
| Test coverage | ~5% | — | ≥60% |
| Uptime target | — | 99.9% | 99.95% |
| Frontend pages with full CRUD | 2/6 | 6/6 | 6/6 + export |

---

## 7. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **OEE** | Overall Equipment Effectiveness = Availability × Performance × Quality |
| **Hypertable** | TimescaleDB's time-optimized table that partitions data automatically by time/chunk |
| **Chunk** | Individual partition within a hypertable (time + space dimensions) |
| **Continuous Aggregate** | Pre-computed summaries at regular intervals for fast queries |
| **RetentionPolicy** | Automatic deletion of data older than N days to control storage |

---

## 8. Open Questions

| # | Question | Owners / Notes |
|---|----------|---------------|
| Q1 | Estimated daily telemetry volume (data points per day)? | Depends on number of OPC UA nodes × sample rate → need PLC inventory |
| Q2 | Do we need multi-tenant support? | Current design assumes single factory installation |
| Q3 | Any regulatory requirements (FDA 21 CFR Part 11, audit trails)? | Would require immutable logs + change history per order |
| Q4 | Maximum acceptable dashboard latency for machine status? | Real-time (<1s) or near-real-time (<5s)? |
| Q5 | Should alarm acknowledgments be logged for compliance? | Recommend: yes, with user_id + timestamp + reason field |
